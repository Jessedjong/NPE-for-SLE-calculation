# NPE-for-SLE-calculation
This repository contains three files
The "Data understanding" file was used for the data understanding part of this project, as well as to prepare the data for the visualizations in the thesis
The "NPE and testing" file was used to calculate NPE as well as use the SIR and SIS model to test it
The "SLE calculation" file contains a final function that takes as input:
- An OT network in the same form as the networks shared by Nautilus OT during this project
- The desired ratios that each asset type should receive

The function will then have as output the final SLE values calculated as described in the thesis
